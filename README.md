This project, deals with continiously checking the quality and the present situation of the bridges. We are doing this uisng a wide array of sensors, like the ultrasonic sensor, which is going to detect collisions in the bridges.
THere are other sensors like DHT11, which is going to measure the temperature and humidty so we can get a live feedback of the sag or tension in the supports of bridge.
We have also used a gyroscope to detect sudden movements in the bridge, it is going to help us by detecting earthquakes, so that the entances from all the sides of the bridge can be restricted, reducing or even preventing casualties.
The servo motor is going to control the tension in the supports of the bridge, this is particularly helpful for long bridges.

Overall by this project, we can check the present health status of the bridge.
